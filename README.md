# Display a 3D object in a Solar Plane

## Objective
The objective is to simulate the position of points of a model in the plane orthogonal to direction of the sun beams.

With the help of the range bar, The user can vary either :

- The position of the object in the X-Y Plane
- Change the position of the azimuth of the sun
- Change the position of the elevation of the sun

The user can reset the position of the object and access to different plane view. The azimuth and elevation angle are changed.

All the angle are indicated and some graphical indicator allow a better understand of the orientation of the 3D model.


## Matrix Lib
Simple Matrix library to calculate:
- matrix transpose
- 2 matrices multiplication
